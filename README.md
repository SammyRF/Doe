This project built with an idea different as usual Machine Learning. Instead of normal case, which mines huge data and train model very well, here is data very limited.

In real industry world, in order to calculate one useful data, it might take several days. That is why the data is so limited.
The idea here is we train with limited data (we tried mostly only with Machine Learning, because there is no enough data for Deep Learning), and try to get best model. With this model, we can generate and predict with huge faked data. In the end engineer reevaluate the best predicted results, check if it is really useful in real world.

Surprise thing is this idea works, we tried this with real engineering project and help the engineer find best solution quickly. And it saves more than 90% engineering time in best case.
